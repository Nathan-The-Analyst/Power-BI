#Through this project, I transformed a raw professional survey collected online into actionable insights.

The process involved:
-> Data Cleaning: I meticulously cleaned the survey data to ensure its accuracy and consistency.
-> Data Analysis: Leveraging Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the cleaned data to extract valuable trends and patterns.
-> Data Visualization: I created an informative dashboard using Power BI to effectively showcase the insights gleaned from the analysis.
